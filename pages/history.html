        <h2>What is p5.js?</h2>
        <p>p5.js is a JavaScript library for creative coding, developed by Lauren McCarthy, Casey Reas, and Ben Fry in 2013. It is built on top of the popular Processing language and is designed to make it easier for artists, designers, and students to create interactive graphics, animations, and other visual projects using web technologies.</p>

        <section class="history-card">
        <h2>The Origins of p5.js</h2>
        <p>p5.js was originally created by Lauren McCarthy as a tool for teaching creative coding to students at NYU's Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP). She wanted to create a library that would be more accessible and user-friendly than existing tools, and that would allow students to quickly experiment and prototype their ideas.</p>
        
        <p>McCarthy later teamed up with Casey Reas, one of the co-creators of Processing, and Ben Fry, a well-known data visualization expert, to further develop and refine p5.js. They released the first version of the library in 2013, and it has since grown in popularity and influence within the creative coding community.</p>

        <h2>Key Features of p5.js</h2>
        <p>One of the main goals of p5.js is to make it easy for beginners to get started with creative coding. To that end, the library offers a number of features that simplify the process of creating interactive graphics and animations. Some of these features include:</p>
    
        <ul class="history-bullets">
          <li>A simple syntax for drawing shapes, lines, and other visual elements</li>
          <li>Built-in functions for mouse and keyboard interactions, as well as input from cameras, microphones, and other sensors</li>
          <li>Support for loading and manipulating images, sounds, and other media</li>
          <li>A responsive canvas that automatically scales to fit different screen sizes and aspect ratios</li>
          <li>A large community of developers and artists who contribute to the library and share their projects and resources online.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Applications of p5.js</h2>
        <p>p5.js has been used in a wide range of creative projects, from interactive installations and performances to educational tools and data visualizations. Some examples of notable projects created with p5.js include:</p>
    
        <ul class="history-bullets">
          <li>"The Secret Life of Plants," a series of interactive installations by artist Tega Brain that explore the hidden processes of plant communication and growth.</li>
          <li>"Wind Map," a data visualization by Fernanda Viégas and Martin Wattenberg that shows real-time wind patterns across the United States.</li>
          <li>"Colorblind Pal," a mobile app by software developer Alex Tran that helps colorblind users identify and differentiate colors using p5.js.</li>
        </ul>
